Module # 5 Doing Math

In this assignment, I worked with two matrices, A and B. Matrix A is a 10x10 square matrix, so I calculated its determinant. If the determinant was not zero, I found the inverse using the solve() function. If the determinant was zero, I returned a message saying the matrix is singular and doesn't have an inverse. Matrix B is a 10x100 matrix, which is not square, so it doesn't have a determinant or an inverse. I handled both cases by checking the conditions before trying to compute the inverse and printed appropriate messages.



> # Define matrix A
> A <- matrix(1:100, nrow=10)
> 
> # Define matrix B
> B <- matrix(1:1000, nrow=10)
> 
> # Compute determinant of A
> det_A <- det(A)
> 
> # Check if A is invertible (det(A) â‰  0)
> if (det_A != 0) {
+   inv_A <- solve(A)  # Compute inverse of A
+ } else {
+   inv_A <- "Matrix A is singular and does not have an inverse."
+ }

[1] "Determinant of A:"

[1] 0

[1] "Inverse of A (if applicable):"
> print(inv_A)
[1] "Matrix A is singular and does not have an inverse."
